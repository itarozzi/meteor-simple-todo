Meteor Tutorial - A simple TO DO App
====================================

This is a simple Meteor app created following the first base tutorial by
Meteor framework site:  https://www.meteor.com/tutorials

I started the tutorial using the Blaze frontend (Meteor native and
better integrated). Angular and React version are also available.



Getting started
---------------
```
meteor create meteor-simple-todos
(or clone this repository from github)

cd meteor-simple-todos
meteor npm install
meteor
```

When compiled and started, the app will be available at: http://localhost:3000/

The Mongo DB, if used, is available at localhost:3001 
You can use console shell to manipulate the DB 
```
meteor mongo
```

Or you can use GUI tools, e.g. Robomongo.
